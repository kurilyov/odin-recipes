<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and it was a hit. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. It's great for a covered dish dinner too. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups sour cream</li>
    <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, brown onion and ground beef over medium heat. Add spaghetti sauce, and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer as follows: 1/2 of the ziti, Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 sauce mixture, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese and remaining sauce mixture. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheeses are melted.</li>
